ðŸ‘‹ Hey! My name's Caleb.

I'm based in Brisbane, Queensland, Australia and I work for a company that specialises in virtual tours, YouTour.

When I'm not editing video, I'm ~~mangling~~ perfecting our post-production workflow with custom automations using python scripts and Docker containers.

I mostly work with Python. I've got a decent chunk of Linux experience from over the years and I'm slowly getting better at implementing decent CI/CD on my projects. Haha!

I do a lot of automation scripting for DaVinci Resolve and I'm always keen to find some more elusive developers, so if you're ever keen to collaborate, my Discord handle is **"in03#2202"**.
