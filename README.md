ðŸ‘‹ Yo! My name's Caleb.

I'm based in Brisbane, Queensland, Australia and I work for a company that specialises in virtual tours.
When I'm not editing video, I'm mangling [perfecting] our post-production workflow with custom python scripts and containers.

I mostly work with Python, I've got a decent chunk of Linux experience and I'm just starting to get my feet wet with containerization.
I do a lot of automation scripting for DaVinci Resolve and I'm always keen to find some more elusive developers, so if you're ever keen to collab, my Discord handle is "in03#2202".
